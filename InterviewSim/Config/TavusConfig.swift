/*
 TAVUS ENVIRONMENT SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
 
 ‚úÖ REPLICA ID CONFIGURED: rf4703150052
 
 1. Create a .env file in your project root with:
    TAVUS_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
    TAVUS_BASE_URL=https://tavusapi.com/v2
 
 2. Your Tavus API Key should be working now
    - Make sure it's the complete key from https://platform.tavus.io/api-keys
    - The key should be in format: 3d52ddd842e6428...
 
 3. Replica ID is already configured: rf4703150052
    - This should match a replica in your Tavus dashboard
    - Verify at: https://platform.tavus.io/replicas
 
 4. Test the configuration:
    TavusConfig.validateConfiguration()
    TavusConfig.validateReplicaId()
 
 SECURITY NOTES:
 - Never commit .env file to version control
 - Add .env to your .gitignore file
 - Use different keys for development and production
 - Consider using Xcode build configurations for different environments
